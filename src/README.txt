This 3D viewer is purely composed of javascript that runs locally on your browser.
 It allows you to load 45+ 3D model formats.
It is based on WebGL and Web Assembly technologies as well as the Unity 3D rendering engine and the Assimp library. It also relies on a lot of code I wrote myself.
This demo is entirely developed in React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It allows you to load your own models as well as a series of demo models.

It has been tested with :
Firefox on Windows
Chrome on Windows
Edge on Windows
Safari on iOS (you should disable WebGL2.0 in experimental features)

If WebGL2.0 is not supported, the rendering is switched to WebGL1.0.

Unfortunately, I can't publish the code that decodes 3D formats because I had to buy several proprietary libraries and can only distribute compiled binaries.
